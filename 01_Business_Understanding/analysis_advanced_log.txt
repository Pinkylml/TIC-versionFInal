[Cox_Violation]: Indeed, the performance of these methods has

[Hybridization_Context]: The weighted average distance between the CHFs of the Cox model and the black-box survival model

[Cox_Violation]: One of the
popular regression model for the analysis of survival data is the well-known Cox proportional hazards
model, which is a semi-parametric model that calculates effects of observed covariates on the risk of
an event occurring, for example, the death or failure [11].
[Feature_Selection]: In particular, Tibshirani [51] proposed a modification of the Cox model based on the Lasso
method in order to take into account a high dimensionality of survival data.

[Hybridization_Context]: In recent years, many excellent optimization methods have been successively proposed,

[Feature_Selection]: Excessive family

[Hybridization_Context]: The proposed modifications of SurvNAM are based on using the Lasso-based regularization for

[Cox_Violation]: One of the popular semi-parametric regression models for analysis of
survival data, which takes into account features of training examples, is the Cox proportional hazards
model, which calculates effects of observed covariates (features) on the risk of an event occurring, for
example, the death or failure [19].

[Hybridization_Context]: Khan and Shaw [27] combined AFT with adaptive and weighted elastic nets to enable variable
selection from high-dimensional data.
[Cox_Violation]: Second, the
AFT model may provide a better fit when proportional hazard assumption does not hold
[17].
